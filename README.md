In this project we perform Data Analysis and Dat Visualization on the dataset of the sales accounted during the Diwali Festival.
We use PYTHON to perform EDA.
We will libraries numpy, panda, matplot.lib and seaborn for performing arthimatic operations and filter, working on dataset and analysis and visualization on the data.

And lastly our conclusion of the analysis is ->
Based on our comprehensive analysis of the Diwali sales data, it's evident that key consumer segments driving sales are married women within the 26-35 age bracket, predominantly from states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. These women are often professionals in sectors like IT, Healthcare, and Aviation, and they exhibit a strong preference for products within the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories. Additionally, purchasing behaviors have evolved over time, with distinct patterns emerging between genders and marital statuses, emphasizing the need for tailored marketing strategies.
